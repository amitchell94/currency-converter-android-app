## Project overview
This functions as a lightweight currency conversion app that can be used to instantly convert from a foreign currency to your home currency. Conversion rates for the selected home currency are stored locally on the device to allow for conversion when no internet access is available. 

I created this app as I struggled to find an app that you could open, type in a number in local currency and have it instantly converted to your home currency. When I was backpacking, I would often find myself in a situation where I just wanted to get a rough idea of whether I was being ripped off by a price given to me by a local vendor, a lot of the times I wouldn't have mobile data so I just wanted an app that you could open, type in a number in the local currency and it would instantly tell you the rough conversion. This is what this app is for.
